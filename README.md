# The Archivist
Built as part of the [GooseHacks 2023](https://goosehacks-2023.devpost.com/)'s hackathon, our team successfully developed a web application with the capability to easily archive video content from youtube within the span of a mere 36 hours. We leveraged the Flask framework to achieve efficient and quick-paced development, made possible through the collaborative efforts of our team in a short amount of time.
